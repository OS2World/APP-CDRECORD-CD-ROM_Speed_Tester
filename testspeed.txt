CD-ROM Speed Tester 1.01  (C) 1998-1999 Samuel Audet <guardia@cam.org>

Syntax:
   testspeed <cd drive letter> [/c <bogus cache size in kB>]
             [/t <track,track,...>] [/s <fake cd writing speed>]

The default bogus cache size is 4096 kB.  By default, all tracks are
tested.  The default fake CD writing speed is 4x.

Description
===========

This little utility was made because my brand new Teac CD-R55S doesn't
support test mode (or RSJ doesn't support its test mode).  Since the only
real problem when no test mode is available is the read test (the write
test will always succeed unless the CD was bad is the first place and this
you never know until you actually write to the CD), and since HD are always
fast enough, only duplicating CD tracks remains gloomy if not properly
tested. Even if you have a brand spanking new 40x drive, if your CD has a
nice big scratch right in the middle, you might never get more than 2x from
one of the tracks on it, even if it's only for 1 second, it can be crucial.
You will not know about this before it's too late (ie.: you get a brand new
frisbee), or before using the test mode or this CD-ROM Speed Tester.

This utility will fake a read cache.  If you use an 8 megs cache in your
CD-R software, specify /c 8096 on the command line and the tester will take
in account in its speed calculation the size of the cache, although it
never actually uses one.

Reading CD-DA does no dejittering.  If you need dejittering, it is usually
too slow to do CD->CD copy anyway.  Use another utility than your CD-R
software to grab the track on your HD, and write it back to a blank CD.

If the lowest speed is 4.1x for example, I wouldn't try to copy at 4x,
unless the area is very specific and you can come out of it without hitting
the bottom using a huge cache.  Also take in account that if your CD-ROM
drives are not bus mastered, your CPU might be overloaded during copy which
means CD-ROM Speed Tester might report higher transfer than your CPU is
capable of when writing at the same time in your CD-R software.

Voila, have fun!


History
=======

1.05 - January 30, 1999
----

- Modified readcd to be CTCDROM.DMD compatible (This CD drive manager of
  Unite CD Maker doesn't want to read in the CODE segment, so I had to
  define local variables for the parameter)
- Tracks are now read in order and can be tested multiple times in a row or not.
- Hopefully fixed most screwed up display.
